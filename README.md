## Team 4, Virtual Dice and Coin Flip
In this project, we built a basic Firefox extension where the user can flip a coin or roll a dice.



## Installation
Under the "Clone or Download" dropdown menu, click "Download ZIP" and extract it. Unzip the file. Then, enter about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox in your URL bar. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." button, and select the manifest.json file to load our extension.

## Contributing
Please feel free to share your suggestions under the issues section or implement them if you can. This is a work in progress, and any type of contribution is welcome. Join slack channel "team4" if you want to learn more.
